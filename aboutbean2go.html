      <h2>Origin</h2>
      Bean2Go is a startup that was first concieved at Enspiral's Auckland Dev Academy. It was developed by two students who ran with an idea from one of their amazing teachers as a way to stretch and test the skills they were developing at the academy.
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      Bean2Go aims to help assist both sides of the counter with large coffee orders by providing an efficient channel to remotely pass orders. Freeing up time for business staff by being able to recieve a printed docket with an order, while also freeing up the customers time by reducing time spent waiting in line.
      We aim to provide a utility that is financially clear and easy to implement for business owners and easy to access and utilise for customers.
